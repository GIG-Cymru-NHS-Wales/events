# Software Engineering Lightning Talk Day

Draft - Work In Progress - Request For Collaboration

NHS Wales has many software engineers, and many good ideas. We want to create a
get-together where our teammates can do lightning talks to showcase ideas. 

This is a bit like a TED Talk event, with the talks being focused on software
engineering, including practices, tooling, source code, learning and growth
paths, and the like.

We intend this to be a "soft launch" of our new conference area, and of our new
ways of working. In other words, this is more like a first experiment with
hosting this kind of event, and is less like a fully-professional fully-perfect
conference.

For more please contact Joel Henderson (joel.henderson@wales.nhs.uk).

## Themes

These are work in progress.

**UI: User Interface for software engineering:**

* Example ideas for from-scrath: how to engineer UI/UX designs by using HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.

* Example ideas for tooling: as well as with design tools such as Figma and
Canvas that can code-generate, and with sharable design systems such as GOV.UK
and NHS-X, and sharable component systems such as DaisyUI and Tailwind.

**AI: Artificial Intelligence for software engineering:**

* Example ideas for creating software: how software engineers can use AI to
improve software design, development, testing, deployment, telemetry, and the
like.

* Example iddeas for upskilling: how to leverage AI for learning new skills, such as new programming languages, new software programming paradigms, new tooling, etc.

**QA: Quality assurance for software engineering:**

* Example ideas for testing: how to do unit tests, functional tests, integration
  tests, benchmark tests, fuzz tests, mutation tests, test-driven development,
  etc.

* Example ideas for CI/CD/CT: how to do continous integration, continuous delivery, continous telemetry.

## Talks

We want each talk to be approximately six minutes long, then have a few minutes for questions.

The whole prentation must be maximum 10 mintes, because we want to video each talk and share it with our comms team using their "Ten Talk" approach.

We want each presenter to have a couple of teammates in the crowd prepared with suitable questions, just in case no one else asks anything.

## Schedule

Tenative date: Friday June 6 or Wednesday June 11. We want to do early June
because this when our new big presentation room is likely to be ready. 

We are considering Friday because more of our teammates have more-relaxed schedules. 

We are considering Wednesday because more of our teammates are in the office.

We are considering 9 a.m. to noon for talks, then an hour for pizza lunch
because we want attendees to meet and greet, and discuss the ideas.
