## Advice

If you're hosting an event on site, then this advice may help you.

Consider hiring a profressional cameraperson to film. For example, our organization has successfully hired a professional cameraperson at [Shockwave Digital](https://www.shockwavedigital.io/). Approximate budget cost is Â£100/hour.

Consider providing drinks, such as water, tea, coffee, juice, etc. 

Consider providing food, such as pastries for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch, pizza for dinner, etc.

Test your audio capabilties. For example, our organization has hosted events that are in mid-sized conference rooms, where the speaker didn't have a microphone; this made the audio hard to hear for remote participants.

Get all speakers on site an hour before, so they can prepare, and to help reduce last-minute changes and last-minute activies.
